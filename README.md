\# Unity\_AutoRigBuilder



🚀 \*\*Unity Auto Rig Builder\*\* is an editor tool that helps you quickly generate a basic humanoid rig setup using Unity’s Animation Rigging package.



The goal of this tool is to \*\*reduce repetitive rig setup work\*\* by automatically creating:

\- Rig hierarchy

\- Controls (Head, Arms, Legs, etc.)

\- IK constraints

\- Clean editor-friendly structure



This tool is especially useful for \*\*prototyping, gameplay rigs, and procedural characters\*\*.
